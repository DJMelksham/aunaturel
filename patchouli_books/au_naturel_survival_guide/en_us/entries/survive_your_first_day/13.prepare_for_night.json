Bring in some food, wood, maybe some copper or iron ore if you were lucky, and try to build near potential water sources.  Save tasks up to overcome boredom and try not to do these during the day."},

If you have excess wood you may wish to craft some chests or a barrel for storage. Brave souls have been known to venture out at night, but know it is not without its risks."
